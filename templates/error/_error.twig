 # This is just a default base, and example only.
 #
 ### Installing in your theme:
 # Create a Twig template file in your theme directory, that inherits your page
 # layout and then add the following block:
 #     {% block members_error %}
 #     {% endblock members_error %}
 #
 ### Configuring Members to use your template parent:
 #
 # Next step is to set the error_parent: template key to the relative path to
 # template file.
 #
 # For example if you have a theme directory 'koala' and you create the directory
 # themes/koala/extensions/members/ you can then put what templates files
 # you need there.
 #
 # In app/config/extensions/members.bolt.yml set the following to override
 #
 #     template:
 #       error_parent: extensions/members/members_error.twig
 #}
{% block members_error %}
{% endblock members_error %}
