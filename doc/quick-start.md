Quick Start Guide
-----------------


The default Twig templates in Auth have been done with Bolt's base theme
(currently`base-2016`) in mind. 

If you are setting up Auth for the first time, you may find it useful to 
first test on a site set up to run the current base theme, and then switch over
when you're happy with how it is working.

* [Install the extension](#install-the-extension)
* [Update database](#update-database)
* [Enable an authentication provider](#enable-an-authentication-provider)
* [Configure outgoing mail](#configure-outgoing-mail)
* [Enable registration](#enable-registration)
* [Templates](#templates)
  * [Authentication](#authentication)
  * [Profiles](#profiles)
* [Set up initial test greeting](#set-up-initial-test-greeting)
* [Registering your first user](#registering-your-first-user)
* [Final words](#final-words)


#### Install the extension
 
See the [installation page](installation.md), and ensure you've updated the site's database 

Enable [debug mode](debugging.md) to get additional feedback from Auth during
set up.


#### Update database

#### Enable an authentication provider

Set up the [Local authentication provider](authentication-providers.md), and set `enabled: true`

```yaml
providers:
    local:
        enabled: true
        keys:
            client_id: localdefault
            client_secret: localdefault
        scopes: [ user ]
```


#### Configure outgoing mail

You should have already done this as part of your inital setup of Bolt.  But
double-check that bolt can send mail to users and auth.  The Auth plugin
relies on outgoing mail to be working and may fail silently if it can't.  Look
for the <tt>mailoptions</tt> setting in <tt>config.yml</tt>

**Note:** On some servers it is required that you set a correct name and email 
address for the notifications. If this is not configured your email may not be
sent at all.

```yaml
notifications:
    name: This is your email name
    email: noreply@example.com
```

#### Enable registration

In order to register your first account, you need to enable registration in 
your Auth configuration file, e.g.:

```yaml
registration:
    enabled: true
```

**Note:** If you get 404 responses when trying to visit the registration URL
then most likely you forgot to enable this setting.


#### Templates

Templating is very configurable. At a minimum, Auth needs "parent"
templates to inherit layout from.  

Usually the parent role is split in two groups, "authentication", and "profiles".

By default, Auth will use its own minimal parent templates that extend the
Bolt base theme's master template.

However if you wish to create your own, just set the relative path to them in
your theme directory in Auth configuration file, e.g.:

```yaml
templates:
    authentication:
        parent: auth/_authentication.twig
    profile:
        parent: auth/_profile.twig
```

Finally add the blocks from the sections below to your desired position your
custom parent template.


##### Authentication

```twig
    {# Password & OAuth2 provider login forms #}
    {% block login %}
    {% endblock login %}

    {# Logout form #}
    {% block logout %}
    {% endblock logout %}

    {# Password recovery forms #}
    {% block recovery %}
    {% endblock recovery %}
```


##### Profiles

```twig
    {# Auth profile edit & view forms #}
    {% block auth %}
    {% endblock auth %}
```


#### Set up initial test greeting

**NOTE:** Do not attempt to complete this section by adding this Twig snippet
to a HTML field in a ConentType record â€¦ It will **not** work.

Add the snippet below somewhere in a template for an existing URL, and browse to the URL. 

```twig
    {% if is_auth() %}
        {% set auth = auth() %}

        <p>Hello, {{ auth.displayname }}. You were last seen at {{ auth.lastseen }},
        logging on from {{ auth.lastip }}, and your email is {{ auth.email }}</p>
    {% else %}
        <p>Welcome visitor from the Internet!</p>
    {% endif %}
```

When you've not yet registered and logged in, you should see the message 
"Welcome visitor from the Internet!" displayed. 

Upon login (still coming below), refreshing this page should display the
personalised greeting.


#### Registering your first user

If everything so far has worked, you should now be able to visit the
registration page, by default found at the URI `/auth/profile/register`

You will require a valid email address, e.g. DNS has a valid mail server 
registered. Meaning `@example.com` won't work
