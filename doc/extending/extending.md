Extending Members
-----------------

Members is event driven and provides a number of dispatcher that your own
extension can listen for, and affect the behaviour of different parts of the
Members extension. 

There is an example repository called [Members Addon Example](https://github.com/bolt/Members-Addon-Example) 
that shows some of the available behaviour.

See:
  * [Adding meta fields](adding-meta-fields.md)
  * [Adding roles](adding-roles.md)
  * [Events](events.md)
